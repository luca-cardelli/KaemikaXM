On https://github.com/luca-cardelli/Kaemika click the green "Clone or Download" button.
Then click "Download ZIP".
Unzip the resulting KaemikaXM-master.zip and open it.

For Windows installation:
Inside the KaemikaXM-master/KaemikaWPF/bin/Release folder there is a KaemikaWPF.exe executatble that can be simply run without formal installation.

Running it will raise some security warnings, and possibly a short virus scan.
The executable is unsigned because signing it causes endless trouble and inability to install depending on the particular software setup on your computer. 

Caveat utilitor.
